# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Task

Our task was to create a website resembling that of the demo gif provided, with the functionality to match.
I'm going to go right ahead and say that this one was more challenging than I expected, and it has made me realize that I need to devote more time to learning these basic processes, even as we move on to more complicated material.
With that being stated, the homework as it is being submitted is incomplete, and I don't doubt it will be graded as such. 


## User Story


An employer would like to view a sample portfolio for a prospective interviewee, so they can assess the candidate's eligibility for a position.
Thus far, mine would indicate the answer is "no".
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

Partially

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

Yes

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

Yes

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

Yes

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

No

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Sort of, leaning towards not really.


## Mock-Up

The following picture shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
